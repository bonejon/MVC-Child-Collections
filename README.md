# MVC Child Collections
Every couple of projects I bump into the desire to create a new entity with a collection of child entities, but only make a single call to the server.

A few years ago I put together some code using MVC 4, jQuery templates, and some MVC magic to make this work. However I keep having to copy and refactor is about and find all the parts. This project aims to be a simple demo to show how this can be achived...

For the latest version of the code see the develop branch, periodically when the code is stable I will merge develop into master.
